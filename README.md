# Contact-List
• Implemented a contact list that gave users access to their contacts based on the name, email, and phone number in C++ using classes along with vectors to store the contacts, which resulted in a functioning contact list for the user.

• Involved both the front and back end to get the user face and the functionality of the contacts list.

• Used a variety of built-in functions for vectors, strings, and an input file.
